# Image Optimization

  </ul>
</details>

Since version **10.0.0**, Next.js provides an Image component to automatically optimize the source image. The optimization includes resizing the image based on the browser's viewport, as well as selecting the best format (such as [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)) based on the browser's [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) header.

The objective of the Image component is to improve the performance of Next.js applications, with a particular focus on improving their [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) scores.

## Default Behavior

To add an image to your application, import the Image component on your [page](/docs/basic-features/pages).

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image src="/me.png" alt="me" width={200} height={200} />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## Configuration

You can configure Image Optimization by using the `images` property in `next.config.js`.

### Sizes

You can specify a list of image widths to allow using the `sizes` property. Since images maintain their aspect ratio using the `width` and `height` attributes of the source image, there is no need to specify height in `next.config.js` â€“ only the width. You can think of these as breakpoints.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    sizes: [320, 420, 768, 1024, 1200],
  },
}
```

### Domains

To enable Image Optimization for images hosted on an external website, use an absolute url for the Image `src` and specify which
`domains` are allowed to be optimized.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com'],
  },
}
```

### Loader

If you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js API, you can configure the loader and path prefix. This allows you to use relative urls for the Image `src` and automatically generate the correct absolute url for your provider.

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    loader: 'imgix',
    path: 'https://example.com/myaccount/',
  },
}
```

## FAQ

### Can I bring my own cloud provider?

The following Image Optimization cloud providers are supported:

- Imgix: `loader: 'imgix'`
- Cloudinary: `loader: 'cloudinary'`
- Akamai: `loader: 'akamai'`
- Vercel: No configuration necessary
